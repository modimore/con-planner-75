# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
    room_name: 'Room 1'
    convention_name: 'Test Convention 1'

two: 
    room_name: 'Room 3'
    convention_name: 'Test Convention 1'

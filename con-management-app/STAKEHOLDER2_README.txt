BECAUSE DEFAULT PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE FOR ANDROID APPS IS NONINTUITIVE...

Code we worked on for the mobile application is in path: con-management-app/app/src/main

The android manifest is in the above folder. 

Activity files ("pages" of the application) are located at ../java/lml/con_management_app

There is a small test located at ../java/test

And util files (custom objects & some classes to read database input) are located at ..java/utils 

There are also layout & fragment files at ../res/layout
